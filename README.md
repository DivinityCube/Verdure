# Verdure
A calorie tracking app made in Python. Uses the PyQt6 libraries. 

This app was originally made for the purpose of helping me to track my calories so I could become healthier. I hope it helps others too.

I'll release major changes (such as drastic UI overhauls) every year (the version number is the last 2 digits of the current year, e.g. 2025 = Verdure 25). Minor changes (such as new features) will be a .1 release (e.g. Verdure 25.1, Verdure 25.2, etc.)
